# 🔥 The Phoenix Spark

A real-time, high-performance visualization engine built with Elixir and Phoenix, designed to handle and display high-volume API activity on a dynamic canvas.

This project demonstrates the power of the Elixir, the Phoenix Framework, and Phoenix Channels for building robust, concurrent, and low-latency real-time applications. It functions as a server that ingests a high volume of parameterized API requests generated by either a Python bombardment script or an interactive Go controller built with Charm Bubble Tea. This request are then broadcasted to a frontend visualizer, which renders the events as "sparks" on a full-screen HTML Canvas.

## ✨ Key Features

- **High-Resolution Coordinate Endpoints:** 262,144 unique API endpoints on a 512x512 grid (`/api/:x/:y`) are handled by a single, parameterized Phoenix Router.
- **Rich Event Parameterization:** API requests accept a JSON body to control the visual effect of each spark, including `color` (HSL), `radius`, `transparency`, and animation `duration`.
- **Asynchronous Broadcast Engine:** The controller provides an immediate `202 Accepted` response and delegates the broadcasting to a non-blocking background task for maximum throughput.
- **High-Performance Frontend Visualizer:** A full-screen, borderless HTML Canvas display that dynamically scales the 512x512 coordinate space to the viewport. Animations are rendered using a `requestAnimationFrame` loop for smoothness.
- **Robust Data Validation:** A dedicated `SparkEvent` data contract module uses Ecto changesets to validate all incoming API data for type, presence, and valid ranges.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir `~> 1.15`
- Erlang/OTP `~> 26`
- Python 3 (for the bombarder script)
- Go (for the CLI controller)

### 1. Setup the Backend

First, install the Mix dependencies:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

If this is the first time you are running the project, you may also need to create and migrate your database (although it is not actively used by the core application):

```sh
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
```

### 2. Run the Server

Start the Phoenix server:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Now you can visit [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to see the canvas.

### 3. Run the Bombarder Scripts

To see the visualization in action, you can use one of the bombarder scripts. These scripts are designed to send a high volume of parameterized API requests to the Phoenix server, triggering the visual "sparks" on the canvas.

#### Python Bombarder Script (V1)

This script is designed for maximum throughput and visual flair, sending thousands of requests per second with dynamically changing colors, sizes, and animations.

**Example:** Run the bombardment for 30 seconds.

```sh
./scripts/bombard.py --duration 30
```

See all available options by running:

```sh
./scripts/bombard.py --help
```

#### Go Bombarder Controller (V2)

This is an interactive CLI tool that provides real-time control over the bombardment parameters. It offers sliders for adjusting concurrency, request rate, spark radius, transparency, and growth duration. This version was developed to provide a more dynamic and controlled testing experience, addressing some of the limitations of the Python script at very high loads.

**To run the Go controller:**

First, navigate to the `cli/bombard-controller` directory:

```sh
cd cli/bombard-controller
```

Then, run the controller:

```sh
go run .
```

Use the arrow keys to navigate the sliders and adjust values. Press `Space` or `Enter` to start/pause/resume the bombardment. Press `q` or `ctrl+c` to quit.
